VIAL config for my Corne (foostan/crkbd) RGB keyboard. 
The keyboard config is in [keymap.vil](./keymap.vil).

## Keyboard Specs

These are the specs for my keyboard:
- Keyboard: [Corne (foostan/crkbd)](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) (v4.1)
- Firmware: [VIAL](https://get.vial.today/) ([QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) fork)
- Vendor: [Keebart](https://www.keebart.com/) ([keyboard reference](https://www.keebart.com/products/corne))
- RGB Lighting: yes
- QMK keyboard id: `crkbd/rev4_1`

## Layout

To better understand how I use my keyboard, I have *split* the layout in two parts:
- **Hardware layout:** How the keys are mapped via the keyboard firmware itself.
- **Software layout:** OS emulation layer that remaps some keys (ex: `qwerty`, `azerty`, `dvorak`, `colemack`, etc.)

### Hardware Layout

I primarly use two layers (layer 0 and 1) for most of my daily work.
I have two additional layers for extra keys I might need at times.

**Default Layer:** Letters and common symbols

**Layer 1 (NavNum):** Numbers, navigation keys and media keys

**Layer 2:** Function Keys (F1 - F20)

**Layer 3:** Mouse actions and RGB control

### Software Layout

I have recently moved from QWERTY over to [Ergo-L](https://ergol.org/).
Similarly to [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) or [Colemack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak), Ergo-L is an ergonomic keyboard layout.

Ergo-L is well thought out and optimized for typing in French, English and offering an easy access to programming symbols.
The layout comes with three main "layers":
- Default layer for letters
- [Alt Graph (Right Alt)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key) modifier key for symbols (with easy to reach programming symbols)
- [Dead Key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key) for diacritical marks (accents)

It's a really cool project and it fits my use case perfecly!

I recommend taking a look at their website. It is full of useful information and also has some very good advice when it comes to learning a new keyboard layout.

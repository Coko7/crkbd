> [!NOTE]
> Regarding my "OS keyboard layout", I have recently moved over from QWERTY to [Ergo-L](https://ergol.org/).
> Ergo-L is an ergonomic keyboard layout optimized for typing in French, English and with easy to access programming symbols.
> It's a really cool project and it fits perfectly with my use case. It's worth checking out.
